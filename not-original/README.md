# Sports Store E-commerce App
!!!! I am changing this project

Is a full-stack MERN application. Replacing mongodb database with the database provided by json-server.

And the application is a follow-up tutorial from the book Pro React 16 by Adam Freeman. 
With little tweaks made on the react components and redux datastore
